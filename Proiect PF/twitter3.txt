6-Oct-20,@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri We‚Äôre not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.
6-Oct-20,@PPathole @alvianchoiri Roughly a week or two turnaround is all that‚Äôs needed to meet max launch demand. Starship Super Heavy is designed for reflight in less than an hour.

15-Jun-20,"@Mad_Maelstrom @Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners.

15-Jun-20,"@Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Yeah.

24-Jun-19,@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It‚Äôs a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
24-Jun-19,"@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."

24-Jun-19,@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

19-Dec-18,"@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
19-Dec-18,"@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
19-Dec-18,"@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
19-Dec-18,"@FredericLambert @boringcompany You‚Äôre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear."
19-Dec-18,"@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!"

16-Oct-18,@SmileSimplify @j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert ~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
16-Oct-18,@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
16-Oct-18,"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."

6-Jul-18,"@MattyIce4412 @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about in that tweet ‚Äî double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
6-Jul-18,@williamwinters @austinhopperrrr @maysacha @thanr @JamesWorldSpace Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube &amp; rock wall.

Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?

6-Jul-18,@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
6-Jul-18,"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won‚Äôt come in"
6-Jul-18,"@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
6-Jul-18,@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
6-Jul-18,"@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
6-Jul-18,"@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
6-Jul-18,@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
6-Jul-18,"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
6-Jul-18,@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.

20-Jun-18,"@vplikeTRUMP @jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high."

20-Jun-18,"@jorendewachter @xJawz @joerogan @MazzucatoM He‚Äôs obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak &amp; a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation."
20-Jun-18,@EvilCorpGame Great name. A little on the nose.
20-Jun-18,"@DanAloni @xJawz @joerogan That‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital.

20-Jun-18,"@xJawz @joerogan Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced &amp; above 50% too negatively affects economic output."

17-Jun-18,@indiemusicfan9 @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
17-Jun-18,@TeslaCharts How big is your short position? Just curious.
17-Jun-18,@BobbieBees @dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda &amp; hand them to me. This one guy‚Äôs claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
17-Jun-18,"@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
17-Jun-18,"@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn‚Äôt have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can‚Äôt even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they‚Äôre getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
17-Jun-18,"@TheSithSeth @doctorow I‚Äôm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don‚Äôt want Tesla to die too."

18-May-18,Excited for @boringcompany partnership with LA Metro  https://t.co/hpqXC3yjQ6
17-May-18,lol  https://t.co/jTV7jhLWYP
17-May-18,Listening to REALiTi
17-May-18,"@kevinmitnick Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
16-May-18,@Manuel_Castillo Yes
16-May-18,Will be presenting &amp; taking questions  about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at 7pm on Thursday
16-May-18,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground &amp; ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins  https://t.co/VhpfhgdXSd
14-May-18,"@andrewbg Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
14-May-18,"@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
14-May-18,What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
14-May-18,"It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU"
14-May-18,@sokane1 @TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins Yes
14-May-18,"@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
14-May-18,"@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
14-May-18,@mayemusk Happy Mother‚Äôs Day Mom! Love you so much.

13-May-18,Good piece by Ars  https://t.co/7C3X0TjUX9
12-May-18,@RitaJKing Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
12-May-18,"@DylanNeumann2 @Everman Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines ‚Äî quaint, but not something you‚Äôd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general."
12-May-18,"@Everman Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."

11-May-18,"@existentialcoms Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange ‚Ä¶"

4-May-18,"@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
4-May-18,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
4-May-18,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"

4-May-18,"@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The ‚Äúdry‚Äù questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."

22-Mar-17,@karaswisher I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.

5-Feb-17,"@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."

7-May-16,@tzepr Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
7-May-16,@LifeOfRockstar I think so
7-May-16,@lukealization Max is just 3X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.

1-May-16,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
1-May-16,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
1-May-16,"@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"
30-Apr-16,"@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
30-Apr-16,@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
30-Apr-16,@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
30-Apr-16,"@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin."

30-Apr-16,@vigneshraju of course
30-Apr-16,@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
29-Apr-16,"@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely."
29-Apr-16,@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand &gt;&gt; supply.
29-Apr-16,@erothenberg checking into it ...
27-Apr-16,@romn8tr will definitely do so
27-Apr-16,"@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
27-Apr-16,"@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
27-Apr-16,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.

3-Apr-16,@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
3-Apr-16,@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system
3-Apr-16,@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
3-Apr-16,@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
3-Apr-16,@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
3-Apr-16,@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
3-Apr-16,@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.

25-May-13,Worth reading Merchants of Doubt. Same who tried to deny smoking deaths r denying climate change  http://t.co/C6H8HrzS8X
25-May-13,"Yeah, climate change should really be considered a centrist issue, as it affects everyone."
25-May-13,"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost &amp; shift to sustainable energy"
25-May-13,"Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
25-May-13,Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
25-May-13,What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.
25-May-13,@kn0xvi11ain Very few. Scientific consensus at time of Columbus was world was round  http://t.co/V3XIcob4s8
25-May-13,"Sorry for all the heavy stuff abt climate change, but I really thought world wd take action sooner. No time for subtlety"
25-May-13,@1stHubbleFan @keithwarren Exactly
25-May-13,"In reality, 97% of scientists agree that we face serious human generated climate change  http://t.co/soQCnJB61B"
25-May-13,"Climate change deniers claim ""scientists disagree"", same rebuttal used by tobacco industry about lung cancer for decades"
25-May-13,"Good article on ""Climate Change"" vs ""Global Warming"" referred by @ForrestTanaka  http://t.co/D1s4RJ0qus"
25-May-13,"Was beat up pretty badly as a kid &amp; left me w jagged septum. Harder to breathe as I got older, so time to fix."
25-May-13,"Had a minor operation, so am in bed in meds. Probably shouldn't be tweeting :)"
25-May-13,Sign of a good design is that it feels and is much bigger on inside than looks on outside
25-May-13,@CosmicRami Awesome. We really need to promote that fact in the US. A CO2 tax will not cause economy to grind to a halt!
25-May-13,"Would love to do a pickup truck. Something w ultra low cg for sports car handling, dynamic air suspension &amp; mega torque."
25-May-13,"Technically, I ""got rich"" from Zip2 &amp; PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla &amp; SolarCity."
25-May-13,"If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds."
25-May-13,"@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt."
25-May-13,"Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems."
25-May-13,"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
25-May-13,"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)"
25-May-13,Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
25-May-13,Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
25-May-13,@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
25-May-13,"Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."
25-May-13,"@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census."
25-May-13,"Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases."
25-May-13,"Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide."
25-May-13,"Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad."
25-May-13,"Great article on Tesla-dealer battle by Leilani Munter (@CarbonFreeGirl), who lives in NC  http://t.co/pvEmE5pEVN"
24-May-13,@VarunG_ Belief in climate change isn't necessary. Even a small probability of a severe outcome justifies a carbon tax.
24-May-13,@karlbrauer Making rockets
24-May-13,@tonykatz Don't like having a zillion tweets in the log. Makes it tough to wade through if someone wants to read my tweet history.
24-May-13,"@SapientCapital We created electric cars to help solve the problem, not because we thought it was easy money. Still isn't."
24-May-13,"And, since we will run out of oil anyway, why risk the future of all life on Earth simply to delay sustainable energy?"
24-May-13,Those who would deny climate change should ask themselves what happens if they are wrong  http://t.co/S7fOIrly6B
23-May-13,"More importantly, @Chrysler failed to pay back $1.3B. Apart those 2 points, you were totally 1st  http://t.co/0P2ZLDl67a"
23-May-13,"As many have already noted, @Chrysler is a division of Fiat, an Italian company. We specifically said first *US* company."
23-May-13,Interview with @BloombergNews about Tesla and DOE loan gets into some of the details  http://t.co/xb0JVoPHNC
22-May-13,Tesla wired the funds to repay the DOE loan today. Only US car company to have fully repaid govt  http://t.co/jxHW9YkvPz
20-May-13,@Gizmoman0 Physics
20-May-13,@yes_andre I'm a big fan of ultracapacitors. Was going to do my PhD at Stanford on them. But we need a breakthrough in energy density...
19-May-13,@McBartVolgers @SpaceX High pressure helium pneumatic bolts and pistons. No explosives.
19-May-13,"@xyrth Cool, will get one plus another chicken"

18-May-13,Petting zoo left a chicken behind at the park. Now we have a pet chicken.
15-May-13,@DanaBrunetti Soon Model S will feature druidic dwarves dancing around a miniature stone henge
14-May-13,"@DanaBrunetti Well, you see, by making it go to 11, that makes it louder than loud :)"
14-May-13,Supercharger announcement pushed to next week. Something else this week.
13-May-13,"@bryanclarke physics + a broad range of engineering. Worth taking humanities courses too, particularly history."
13-May-13,"@vicorly Yes, usually several times more energy over the course of the year than is needed by the Model S"
13-May-13,@malkosh we do
13-May-13,"@itsokayyouknow Harder than that, but it is a software vs hardware change"
13-May-13,"Btw, vast majority of credit for SolarCity should go to Lyndon &amp; Peter Rive &amp; their awesome team. I'm just a small part."
12-May-13,@SeanChin @RaimisJ Over the air upgrade coming in a few months to allow tethering (and other things).
12-May-13,Improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. Not sales constrained.
12-May-13,@annabananastand It can do hands free right now. Being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add...
12-May-13,"@enggirl Mostly water or coffee at home. When I'm out, will have Macallan neat or vodka with something."
12-May-13,@danielmarshal15 It can dig up almost anything.
12-May-13,"@JasonPolstein Yeah, we don't do a good job of telling people about this feature. Requires hardware unfortunately."
12-May-13,"@grimmerkimmer @dpinsen Given the extreme burn, shorts are pushing every possible fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt story  http://t.co/LWr3GODxBG"
12-May-13,"@RaimisJ Tesla software knits together Google Voice, Slacker, Gracenote &amp; others and streams over 3G (will be LTE later)"
12-May-13,"@dpinsen People tell me Cory Johnson is a shill for the shorts. Don't know if true, but he sure behaves that way."
12-May-13,"Would also recommend the Cheese Shop, Spam or Fish License by Monty Python."
12-May-13,"Hold down voice button &amp; say ""Play Amish Paradise by Weird Al Yankovic"". Model S can play almost any song via Internet."
9-May-13,@realbhuwan Don't forget the mystery announcement. Part 5 of the trilogy.
9-May-13,There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
9-May-13,@HowardReiter Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.
9-May-13,@mjasandoval Stay tuned
8-May-13,"Just want to say thanks to customers &amp; investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you."
8-May-13,@westcoastbill Thanks Bill!
7-May-13,"Am a fan of Larry, Sergey &amp; Google in general, but self-driving cars comments to Bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. No big announcement here"
7-May-13,"Tesla priority is electrification of cars, so priority is Model S, Model X, then mass market third gen vehicle &amp; truck"
7-May-13,@rebel_sal exactly
7-May-13,"Creating an autopilot for cars at Tesla is an important, but not yet top priority. Still a few years from production."
7-May-13,@DJFrustration Tested it myself this weekend and was working well. Some songs have licensing prohibiting direct request.
6-May-13,"Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply!"
6-May-13,Chris Porritt from Aston Martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at Tesla  http://t.co/MNUIWDxoXt
6-May-13,"@bdcs Yup, it is super far. Moon is basically in our back yard relative to Mars."
5-May-13,"@nirdthebird Definitely a lot of potential for geothermal, but depends on well depth. Too expensive in most places."
5-May-13,"@DetlefKroeze Yeah, that probably makes sense."
5-May-13,@DouglasBullard @teslamotors Most people have never heard of Nikola Tesla. That will hopefully change over time.
5-May-13,"@flyguynscc @teslamotors yes, that has been the goal from the beginning"
4-May-13,"@fink_justin It can definitely strain relationships, but I loved doing my first company with my brother"

4-May-13,@TeslaTrip you're welcome :)
3-May-13,@thebradholt we need a compelling video that convinces TX lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee.
3-May-13,@Rocco_TheStreet Guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. Why isn't that good?
3-May-13,"@ChrisCowan_  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system."
3-May-13,Am getting lots of questions about the big Supercharger announcement. Aiming to do that the week after next.
3-May-13,"@stoneymonster Yes, this does put an indirect floor on resale value. Should help all owners."
3-May-13,Tesla raises Model S resale value guarantee to highest in auto industry  http://t.co/l5LOXtyP33
3-May-13,@yatpay Side boosters fall short &amp; center core goes too far + Florida is heavily populated. Landing permission tricky :)
3-May-13,"@pataneous We can't formally provide a guarantee w/o restating accounting, but I feel confident about the value anyway."
3-May-13,"@2552nsf Yeah, that is super tricky. Will have to sacrifice a lot of payload to boost back or land on ocean platform."
3-May-13,"@rebel_sal Yes, your article (and many others) rightly identified that we made a mistake. New financing is not perfect, but much better."
3-May-13,"@Alan_Nestos The legs are nested tight against the body of the rocket in flight, so rotate about 120 degrees to deploy"
3-May-13,@darma_setia More likely that pigs will fly over the frozen wastes of Hell. Clarkson doesn't understand technology.
3-May-13,@JSONberland We did a ton of testing until they could handle 4X legally required impact energy. Extremely tough.
2-May-13,@BigBalli High pressure helium. Needs to be ultra light. All 4 legs together (~60 ft span) weigh less than Model S.

2-May-13,"@astrostephenson We're aiming for late 2015, but NASA needs to have overlapping capability to be safe. Would do the same"
2-May-13,@MelissaMontoyaO Anne's role is launch site engineering. Don't think she has anything against media -- just not her role.
1-May-13,@realbhuwan @teslamotors Cool :)
1-May-13,@rebel_sal Just read it. Good piece.
1-May-13,@RealTomLangel Maybe a v long time from now. Paying div is a sign that a company cannot find good ways to spend money.
1-May-13,"@wfww Our software is requesting the right song, but Slacker has a bug in their code. Supposed to be fixed by tomorrow."

26-Apr-13,"@tcmeggs Am for good public transit in LA, but the pace of that construction makes the 405 look fast."
26-Apr-13,@tcmeggs This argument is a bit silly. A city will not grow to infinite size just because there isn't traffic.
25-Apr-13,"@NycomWireless @TeslaMotors Cool, thanks for buying our car!"
25-Apr-13,"@Tapp697 Thanks, important clarification. Tesla announcements are always about making product experience better. Market follows eventually."
